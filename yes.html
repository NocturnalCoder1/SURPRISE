				<p class="ay">Hi [Name], Before this year ends I just want to tell you something. I don't know if you already know this but I think you already do but I'll tell it anyways. I do like you, since the day I got to know you, it was September 1, 2023 when we first talked (though it was online). It took me a lot of courage to say this to you right now, even now my heart is beating fast hahaha. I know that I'm kind of a boring person, I won't deny that. I'm more of a shy type person, but once I get close to someone, I get comfortable with them and show them the other side of me. But what I really want to tell you is, you're pretty/beautiful/cute, I am attracted to you but I wasn't entirely attracted to your looks, I feel in love with you when I got to know you better. You are kind, mature, strong, and always looks joyful. I like your personality, and I want to get to know you more, more than I know you now. I love listening to you when you are telling me stories about yourself and your life, it's like time moves slower when I listen to you, it was my first time experiencing such things. I know that this is so random but I'm just shooting my shot anyways and I don't expect any reciprocation because I know you already have a lot of things going on in your life but there's a part of me that I wanna be yours, na sana ako nalang. But as long as I can see you happy I'm okay with it. Keep being amazing, you are perfect imperfectly.

I wanted to confess to you in person, pero didi la an kinaya nak lakas ng loob HAHAHAHAHA.... sge (ready nak ma reject)</p>
